A django billing app for coworking space

This app is designed to manage bills for the coworking space *Cowork'in Montpellier*.
We intend to stay easy and lite. You can manage coworkers information and their respective bills.
We do not use permission system, because each coworker can make is own bills every months, and can also add a new 
coworker. But we use django and it's own user management application. User and group permissions are available.

Warning
=======

Sorry for no documentation right now. I'm writing the application.

I use a virtualenv for python 2.7 with django 1.6, debug toolbar.
If you wanna try it, add a settings_dev.py in core folder.
